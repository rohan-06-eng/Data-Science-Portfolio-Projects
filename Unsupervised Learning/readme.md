## Project Structure

### 1. Clustering
- **Files:**
  - `DBSCAN Implementation.ipynb`: Implementation of the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for clustering.
  - `Hierarchical Clustering Implementation.ipynb`: Demonstrates hierarchical clustering, including dendrogram visualizations.
  - `K Means Clustering Algorithms implementation.ipynb`: Implementation of the K-Means algorithm for partitioning data into clusters.
  - `healthcare.csv`: Dataset used for clustering tasks.
- **Overview:**
  - This section explores clustering techniques to group similar data points based on their features.
  - Algorithms covered:
    - **DBSCAN**: Handles clusters of arbitrary shapes and noise.
    - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds nested clusters using linkage criteria.
    - **K-Means**: Partitions data into K distinct clusters.
  - Applications include grouping healthcare records for patient segmentation.

### 2. Outlier Detection
- **Files:**
  - `DBSCAN Implementation (1).ipynb`: Modified DBSCAN implementation for detecting anomalies in datasets.
  - `Isolation Anomaly Detection.ipynb`: Uses the Isolation Forest algorithm for identifying outliers.
  - `Travel.csv`, `healthcare.csv`: Datasets used for anomaly detection.
- **Overview:**
  - This section focuses on identifying unusual data points that deviate significantly from the majority.
  - Techniques:
    - **DBSCAN**: Detects anomalies as data points not part of any cluster.
    - **Isolation Forest**: Efficiently isolates anomalies in high-dimensional data.
  - Applications include detecting unusual travel patterns or anomalies in healthcare datasets.

### 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Files:**
  - `Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation.ipynb`: Notebook that demonstrates PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
- **Overview:**
  - PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while preserving as much variance as possible.
  - Key Features:
    - Eigenvalue and eigenvector computation.
    - Visualization of reduced dimensions.
    - Application in simplifying complex datasets for clustering and anomaly detection.
