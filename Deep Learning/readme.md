# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects showcasing the application of **Deep Learning** using popular frameworks such as **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. The projects are organized into two main categories: **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. Each folder provides detailed implementations and explanations.

## What is Deep Learning?

**Deep Learning** is a subset of **Machine Learning** that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, known as **artificial neural networks**. It is particularly effective in solving problems involving large datasets and unstructured data like images, audio, and text. By leveraging multi-layered neural networks, Deep Learning can automatically learn feature representations, making it an essential tool for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.

Key features of Deep Learning:
- Utilizes **neural networks** with multiple layers (deep architectures).
- Excels in handling large-scale datasets and complex patterns.
- Requires high computational power and often uses GPUs for faster processing.
