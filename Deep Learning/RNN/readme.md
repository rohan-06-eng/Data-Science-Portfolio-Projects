# **Simple RNN for IMDB Dataset**

This project demonstrates how to use a **Simple RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)** to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. The implementation is done in Python using TensorFlow/Keras.

---

## **Overview**
The IMDB dataset is a collection of 50,000 movie reviews, labeled as positive or negative. This project involves:
1. Preprocessing the data
2. Building and training an RNN-based model
3. Evaluating the model's performance

## **Prerequisites**
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.5+
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
